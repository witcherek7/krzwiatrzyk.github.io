## Github
Wow, it was easier to upload i supposed. First I uploaded only generated 'site' files into username.github.io repository... and that was i mistake. In this kind of scenario i needed two branches (one for pure html and one for jekyll files). I found out that GitHub automatically builds your Jekyll files when GitHub pages is activated on repository. So basically, all I need is one repo with all Jenkins files and when I want to write a post i can do it and push it to the repo and whole building process is done by GitHub or I can create the post on the text editor built inside GitHub page.


## Jekyll
My first mistake when I pushed Jekyll config into the repository was leaving 'localhost' in the url parameter in config.yml file. You have to change it to your page url. In my example: 'krzwiatrzyk.github.io'.
